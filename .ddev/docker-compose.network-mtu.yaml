# Since Gitpod removed slirp4netns as part of performance improvements,
# MTU value should be aligned to the one in gitpod.io
#
# Gitpod fixed it for docker - https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/9356
# and for docker-compose - https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-docker-compose/pull/4
#
# ddev doesn't use Gitpod's custom docker-compose binary. Instead, ddev uses
# its own docker-compose binary at /home/gitpod/.ddev/bin/docker-compose
#
# Align the MTU value to the one that is set in Gitpod (1440)
